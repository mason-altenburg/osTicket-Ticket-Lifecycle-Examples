# 🎫 Ticket Lifecycle Examples

This tutorial demonstrates how tickets flow through the help desk—from creation by an end user to assignment and prioritization by agents.

---

### 1️⃣ End‑User Creates a Ticket

Ken, acting as a customer, creates a ticket:

1. Log in to the **Helpdesk Portal** as `Ken`.  
2. Select **Help Topic**: `Business Critical Outage`.  
3. Fill in **Subject** and **Description**, then click **Submit**.

> 📌 _Help topics let users pick the right category for faster routing._

### 2️⃣ Agents View Live Tickets

Agents monitor **Agent Panel → Tickets** to see incoming tickets in real time.

> 📌 _Queue managers triage and assign tickets to the correct SLAs and technicians._

### 3️⃣ Set Priority, SLA & Assign Technician

For high‑impact issues:

1. Open the ticket details.  
2. Set **Priority** to `Emergency`.  
3. Select **SLA Plan**: `SEV‑A (24/7, 1 hr)`.  
4. Assign the ticket to a top‑level technician.  

> ⚠️ _High‑priority tickets ensure rapid response and proper escalation._
